Gnosis Safe Contracts
=====================

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40gnosis.pm%2Fsafe-contracts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40gnosis.pm%2Fsafe-contracts)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gnosis/safe-contracts.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/gnosis/safe-contracts)

Install
-------
### Install requirements with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### Run all tests (requires Node version >=7 for `async/await`):

```bash
yarn truffle compile
yarn test
```

`yarn test` will start a ganache-cli with the correct configuration. If you want to run `yarn truffle test` you need to start a [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) instance. For this it is required to use the [`--noVMErrorsOnRPCResponse`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli#options) option. This option will make sure that ganache-cli behaves the same as other clients (e.g. geth and parity) when handling reverting calls to contracts. This is required as some flows parse the error message (see https://gnosis-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts/transactions.html#safe-transaction-gas-limit-estimation).

### Deploy

Some contracts require that the Solidity compile target is at least `petersburg` (e.g. GnosisSafeProxyFactory and MultiSend). This is default since [Solidity 0.5.5](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.5.5).

Note: The formal verification was performed using the contract compiled with solcjs 0.5.0.

Preparation:
- Set `INFURA_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Set `NETWORK` in `.env`
- Run `yarn truffle compile`

Truffle:
- Set `MNEMONIC` in `.env`

```bash
yarn truffle deploy
```

### Verify contract

Note: To completely replicate the bytecode that has been deployed it is required that the project path is `/gnosis-safe` this can be archived using `sudo mkdir /gnosis-safe && sudo mount -B <your_repo_path> /gnosis-safe`. Make sure the run `yarn` again if the path has been changed after the inital `yarn install`. If you use a different path you will only get partial matches.

You can locally verify contract using the scripts `generate_meta.js` and `verify_deployment.js`.

With `node scripts/generate_meta.js` a `meta` folder is created in the `build` folder that contains all files required to verify the source code on https://verification.komputing.org/ and https://etherscan.io/

For Etherscan only the `GnosisSafeEtherscan.json` file is required. For sourcify the `GnosisSafeMeta.json` and all the `.sol` files are required.

Once the meta data has been generated you can verify that your local compiled code corresponds to the version deployed by Gnosis with `yarn do <network> scripts/verify_deployment.js`.
