Install
-------
### Install requirements with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### Run all tests:

```bash
yarn build
yarn test
```

### Deploy

Some contracts require that the Solidity compile target is at least `petersburg` (e.g. GnosisSafeProxyFactory and MultiSend). This is default since [Solidity 0.5.5](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.5.5).

Note: The formal verification was performed using the contract compiled with solcjs 0.5.0.

This will deploy the contracts deterministically and verify the contracts on etherscan.

Preparation:
- Set `MNEMONIC` in `.env`
- Set `INFURA_KEY` in `.env`

```bash
yarn deploy-all <network>
```

This will perform the following steps

```bash
yarn build
yarn deploy --network <network>
yarn hardhat --network <network> etherscan-verify
yarn hardhat --network <network> local-verify
```

### Verify contract

This command will use the deployment artifacts to compile the contracts and compare them to the onchain code
```bash
yarn hardhat --network <network> local-verify
```

This command will upload the contract source to Etherescan
```bash
yarn hardhat --network <network> etherscan-verify
```
